# ABOUT

good2meet is a web app that I created with my friend <a href="https://github.com/filipswistowski">Filip</a>. You can use our app for meeting new people, sharing hobbies, spending time together. This repository contains only the front-end code of the app. You can check out the back-end code, created in ASP.NET CORE <a href="https://github.com/PolaZwardon/Good2MeetActivitiesApp">here</a>
To build the app we used many various tools:

- Java Script
- CSS
- React
- Redux


# FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

Our plans for further development are:

- Actually host a website somewhere, so you can check it out on your own :D
- Implement account registration with Google account
- Implement geolocalization
